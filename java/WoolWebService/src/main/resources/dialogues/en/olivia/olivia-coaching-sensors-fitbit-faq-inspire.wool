In principle you can also go to the shower or bath with your activity tracker. However, to ensure its optimal use for many years to come, I recommend that you take it off in the shower.

You do not need to remove your activity tracker during sleep. Actually, your Fitbit Inspire also tracks how much and how well you are sleeping.

Ah, well it might be that the battery is empty. Have you tried charging it?

Plug the charging cable that was given with your activity tracker into a USB port on your computer or into a USB wall charger. Attach the other end of the cable to your device. To make sure that your device is fully charged, you should wait 1-2 hours.â€‹

The activity tracker measures the number of steps per day. Since you're not collecting steps during cycling, the activity tracker doesn't count this as steps.

Okay, first, can you check if Bluetooth is switched on, on the device that is running the Fitbit application?

And how about the Wi-Fi, or mobile network connection... is it switched on? Is the phone or tablet connected to the internet?

[[Yes, it's connected to the internet.|Wifion]]

If it is still not working, try to turn off the bluetooth for a couple seconds, turn it back on and synchronize again.

The activity tracker can measure a restless sleep. It can be possible that you moved during the night or woke up a couple times. The activity tracker will measure a restless sleep while this was not the case. Nothing to worry about!

Your activity tracker is water proof and you can swim with it. By the way, swimming is a great activity to help you achieving the recommended daily activity. So my recommendation is head to that swimming pool!

Also, if you keep wearing it at night, you won't forget to put it on in the morning. We don't want to lose track of those early morning steps right?

Well, the device is waterproof, but the soap and shampoo might damage the wristband. So, although you could keep wearing it in the shower, we advice to take it off anyway.
